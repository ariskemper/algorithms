/**
 * Cube Sort is a relatively simple sorting algorithm that works well
 * for a limited range of input values, such as integers or small ranges
 * of numbers. It's not commonly used in practice due to its limited
 * efficiency for larger datasets.
 *
 * Time Complexity
 * The time complexity of the Cube Sort algorithm is O(n + k),
 * where "n" is the number of elements in the input array,
 * and "k" is the range of values (i.e., the difference between the
 * maximum and minimum values in the array).
 *
 * Best Case: Î©(n)
 * Average Case: O(n log(n))
 * Worst Case: O(n log(n))
 *
 * The overall time complexity is dominated by the counting phase because,
 * in practice, "k" is often much smaller than "n." Therefore, the Cube Sort
 * algorithm is typically considered to have a time complexity of O(n)
 * in most practical cases.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(n)
 *
 * @function cubeeSort
 * @param arr unsorted array
 * @returns sorted array
