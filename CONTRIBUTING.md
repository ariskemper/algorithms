# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By contributing to this repository, you
agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Get Started

- First [fork][fork] the repository and then clone it using:

  git clone git@github.com:your-username/algot.git

- After that create a branch for your changes. For example:
  - feat-XXX if you will add new algorithms or data structures.
  - fix-XXX if you will fix a bug on a certain algorithm or data structure.
  - test-XXX if you wrote a test/s.
  - doc-XXX if you added to or edited documentation or type doc.

You may contribute by:

- implementing new algorithms in the repo. Be sure to keep it under
  right section (e.g. [sort](sort), etc). Make a new section for it if
  it doesn't fall under any section. Make sure that your implementation works.
- optimizing or improving the existing algorithms.
- adding a different solution for the problem.
- finding and fixing bugs.
- adding examples to explain the algorithms better.
- adding test cases.
- improving documentation.

## Pull Requests

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

We will review and may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- All algorithms should be written in **Typescript**.
- Write clean and understandable code.
- Properly comment the code and explain what the algorithm is doing, add time complexity, space complexity in the [typedoc][typedoc].
- You may also explain the output using a minimal example.
- Try to also include a test cases for the algorithm.
- Write a [good commit message][commit].

## Issues

Submit a [new issue][newissue] if there is an algorithm to add, or if a bug was found in an existing algorithm. Before submitting a new issue please review the [existing issues][issues] to avoid creating duplicates. Also, consider resolving current issues or contributing to the discussion on an issue.
